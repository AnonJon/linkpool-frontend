      <h1>What is two-factor or two-step authentication?</h1>
      <p>
        Two-factor authentication is a mechanism that requires users to provide
        two different means of identification when logging in. When you enable
        two-factor authentication in Cryptofuse, users will be required to log
        in with their Cryptofuse password and a random numeric code generated by
        the Google Authenticator application which is available for iPhone,
        Android. In Cryptofuse two-factor is set up on a per-user basis.
      </p>
      <h1>Why would I need this?</h1>
      <p>
        Although the internet is a trusted medium for hosting critical
        applications and information, passwords are often a weak link in the
        chain of security between a web application and a user. Cryptofuse's
        two-factor authentication option allows subscribers to require that
        passwords be used in conjunction with a randomized code delivered to a
        mobile device. Once this code is entered after the initial login
        credentials, the user will be able to access their Cryptofuse account.
        This means enhanced security for all users, and ensures that a weak or
        compromised password canâ€™t be used alone to gain access to sensitive
        data.
